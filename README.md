# Introduction

This demo implements a factorial dynamical Bayesian network
and applies it to physiological monitoring data from babies
receiving intensive care. A set of known artifactual and
physiological patterns can be detected, as well as periods
of clinically significant novelty.

Data in this demo comes from 15 babies who were treated in
the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at the Royal Infirmary of
Edinburgh, UK.

Details about the model and data can be found in

# Data format

The data used in the experiments is contained in the file `data/15days.mat`. The
struct array `data` has two fields, `raw` and `preprocessed`, each of which is a
cell array with elements representing each of the the 15 babies. These elements
are also struct arrays, with fields containing the raw physiological data for each baby, and other information such as gestation and anonymised identifiers.

The struct array intervals contains annotations provided by the clinical
experts. For example, `intervals.BloodSample{3}` contains an array of times
for which a blood sample was thought to have occurred for baby 3. This is an
n Ã— 2 matrix in which each row represents `[start index stop index]` for a
particular episode of blood sampling. Indices are relative to the start of the 24 hour monitoring period.

# How to run the Matlab demo

To run the demo, cd to directory babymonitoringdemo.
Start Matlab and run the command 'chooseexperiment'.

Experiment with the system by editing the files in the
'settings' directory.

See doc/overview.pdf for high-level details of the code.
